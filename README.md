##Details

###Header

Adds **Liked** and **Commented** links to the header navigation for easier access.
The background of the selected link gets coloured.

###Long-Click-Tags

Easily convert certain words to tags in the text entry field when writing a new post.
If a word is already a tag, convert it back into a normal word.
Simply move the mouse over a word that should be converted into a tag and hold down the mouse button. After half a second the word will be converted into a tag.

Example when long-clicking the word "Tag": `Make me a Tag.` *becomes* `Make me a #Tag.`

###Open on my pod

When directly viewing a user, post or tag from a different pod, there is no easy way of opening the page on your own pod.
This feature helps out with that, by adding a button at the top left, needing only 1 click to open it on your pod.

For this feature to work, you will need to set your pod URL first. The input field pops up when you first click the button, or alternatively you can select the green cog that appears next to it.

NOTE: On your own pod, you will not see the button, only the cog to change the saved pod URL.
